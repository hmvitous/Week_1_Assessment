-To initiliaze rspec in a folder you first need to create a Gemfile. In said Gemfile,
you type a source (https://rubygems.org) and the gem you want (rspec).
Next you run gem install bundler in the terminal in the folder you created for a project. Then
run bundle install in terminal. Lastly, run rspec --init to initialize the gem.
